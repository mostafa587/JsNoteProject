# Notes Web App

This project is a simple **Notes Web App** that allows users to sign up, log in, and save personal notes. The notes are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`, so each user has their own set of notes.

## Features

- **Sign Up:** New users can register by providing a username and password.
- **Log In:** Registered users can log in with their credentials.
- **Save Notes:** Once logged in, users can add notes which are saved to their `localStorage`.
- **Persistent Storage:** Notes are saved using the `localStorage`, meaning they persist even if the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.
- **User-Specific Notes:** Each userâ€™s notes are stored separately based on their username.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (with `localStorage` for persistence)

2. **Log In:**
